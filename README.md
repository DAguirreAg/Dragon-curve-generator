# Dragon-curve-generator
Generates and draws a dragon curve depending on the folds requested

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python script to draw dragon curves. With it you can visualize how a “Dragon curve” will look after a specified amount of folds. I was inspired by the amazing video of [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCyC-K_PnRY)  regarding this topic It worths having a look! For more info about the “Dragon curve” click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve). 

## How to use
Just open the script and type the amount of folds you will like to visualize. Be aware that the amount of lines increases exponentially!! So try not to type a crazy number or it will crash your python shell.

## Example
<p align="middle">
  <img src="/Examples/Folds_3.png" alt="dragon curve with 3 folds" width="200">
  <img src="/Examples/Folds_5.png" alt="dragon curve with 5 folds" width="200">
  <img src="/Examples/Folds_9.png" alt="dragon curve with 9 folds" width="200">
</p>
<p align="middle">
  <img src="/Examples/Folds_11.png" alt="dragon curve with 11 folds" width="200">
  <img src="/Examples/Folds_13.png" alt="dragon curve with 13 folds" width="200">
  <img src="/Examples/Folds_16.png" alt="dragon curve with 16 folds" width="200">
</p>

## Future functionalities
In future versions I intend to add other curve plotting types as well as an animation function to see the transition from the previous fold to the next.

## Requirements
You should install the following:
* Python
* Matplotlib
* numpy

## For Developers and coders!
I am aware that some parts could be optimized or are redundant for such small program. However I decided to make it as easy and simple as possible for anybody who is new to programming.
